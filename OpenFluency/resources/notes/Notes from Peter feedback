- Notes from Peter's feedback:
 - fix enrolling
 - practice one thing at a time
 - save what's being practiced in the cardusage
 - choose what to practice before practicing
 - practice images ? TBD
 - clarify percentage
 - add history for the card
 - store different progresses for each thing practiced (pronunciation, meaning, etc)
 - in practice mode, show the progress that realtes to the context
 - in overview mode, display the different progresses (100% meanings, 40% pronunciations, etc)
 - increase size of flashcards
 - provide ability to control registrations
 - flashcard search should go from one language to another, not from one alphabet to another
 - in flashcard search, say what column to search. 
 - remove stroke count and grade level in flashcard search
 - add target language to decks
 - in create flashcards, the pronunciations should only show the one for the target language of the deck
