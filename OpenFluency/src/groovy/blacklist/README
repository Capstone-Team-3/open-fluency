This directory contains the blacklists that are used by the confuser algorithm
to determine if a word shouldn't be displayed. All of the files should take the
format of [language code].blacklist The files allow for comments on lines that
start with a pound sign (#) and anything following a pound sign will also be
treated as a comment. Words should be limited to one per line. For example,

# Example file
